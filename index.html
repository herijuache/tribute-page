                 <li>1919 - moved to Kansas City and worked as an apprentice artist at the Pesmen-Rubin Commercial Art Studio, where he drew commercial illustrations for advertising, theater programs and catalogs, and befriended fellow artist Ub Iwerks </li>

                 <li>1921 - Disney opened a new business with a co-worker from the Film Ad Co, Fred Harman, success led to the establishment of Laugh-O-Gram Studio</li>
                 <li>1923 - Moved to LA and signed a contract for six Alice comedies, with an option for two further series of six episodes each. This lead to Disney and his brother Roy forming the Disney Brothers Studio‍—which later became The Walt Disney Company‍—to produce the films </li>

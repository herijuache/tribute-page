# Tribute Page
This tribute page is an intro project to HTML and CSS. I chose Walt E. Disney because I found the following quote to be inspiring:
> The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.

## Requirements
- [x] My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements
- [x] I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")
- [x] I should see either a figure or a div element with a corresponding id="img-div"
- [x] Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image"
- [x] Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div
- [x] I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page
- [x] I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank")
- [x] The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size
- [x] The img element should be centered within its parent element

## Learned
- Proper HTML structure
- Lists (unordered)
- Linking CSS stylesheets
- Semantics
  - Ex: "main", "figure", "figcaption"
